# Longest Common Subsequence

## Description

Longest Common Subsequence is a simple and very popular dynamic programming
problem. In essence a subsequence of a string is any number of characters that
has the same order as the string. For example `Coding is great!` has
a subsequence `neat`

In this problem we are given two strings A and B and we want to find
the lenght of longest common subsequence of A and B.
